## Screenshots

To add a screenshot of your running application:

1. Take a screenshot of your application running in the browser at http://localhost:8000
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in this directory
3. Ensure the screenshot shows:
   - The input form with sample data
   - The results section with a completed analysis
   - The overall clean UI

## How to Take a Good Screenshot

For the best representation of your project:

1. Use a business example that showcases interesting insights (Tesla, Apple, etc.)
2. Ensure the browser window is sized appropriately (around 1200px wide)
3. Capture the full page to show both the form and results
4. Consider using a browser extension to capture a full-page screenshot

Example of what your screenshot.png should look like:
